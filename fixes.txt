| Add automated column type inference + override | Sometimes Excel exports mix string/float badly (e.g. "3.0", "–", "n/a") |
| Add per-column min/max/mean logging            | Useful for scaling and normalizing later                                |
| Add warnings for high null ratios              | Prevents garbage data from training silently                            |
| Optional cache of preprocessed files           | Avoids re-parsing 100MB spreadsheets every run                          |
| Hook into `model_versioning.py` for provenance | So every training run knows *exactly* what data was used                |

| `EarlyStopping` hook                        | Avoid wasting epochs if loss plateaus                                            |
| Logging (e.g. wandb / tensorboard optional) | Dev insight + graphs for risk/cost planning ML use                               |
| Model eval between increments               | Report accuracy/metrics across time steps                                        |

| Weighted sampling or class balancing        | Especially useful in civil data where events are skewed (e.g., flood vs. normal) |

neural_network.py

BatchNorm or LayerNorm
Especially in deep networks or noisy tabular data, you may benefit from nn.BatchNorm1d or LayerNorm in the layer loop.

Custom init option
Add a flag to support Kaiming or Xavier init — especially useful if you're building deeper nets.

Skip connections / residual option
Could be useful for deep risk analysis, planning graphs, or temporal modeling.

Meta wrapper
Wrap the entire model in a metadata-bearing object so it returns results + structure for explainability (great for engineering reports).
